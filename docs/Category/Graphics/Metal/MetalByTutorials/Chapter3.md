+## The GPU and CPU

Every computer `comes` `equipped` with a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Central Processing Unit (CPU).

每台计算机都配备了图形处理单元（GPU）和中央处理单元（CPU）。

- equipped: US  /ɪˈkwɪpt/ 配备，为某物提供必要的设备或装备。
- comes: 来，表示某物具有或带有某种特征或属性。

The GPU is a specialized hardware component that can process images, videos and massive amounts of data really fast. 

GPU是一种专门的硬件组件，可以快速处理图像、视频和大量的数据。

This operation is known as `throughput` and is measured by the amount of data processed in a specific unit of time. 

此操作称为吞吐量，通过特定时间单位内处理的数据量来衡量。


The CPU, on the other hand, manages resources and is responsible for the computer’s operations. 

另一方面，CPU 管理资源并负责计算机的操作。

Although the CPU can’t process huge amounts of data like the GPU, it can process many sequential tasks (one after another) really fast. 


The time necessary to process a task is known as `latency`.



- massive: 大量的，指数量庞大或规模巨大；
- throughput: 吞吐量
